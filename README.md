A small tetris game made with Unity.

-------------------------------------
Start Scene:

Player can chose between different levels (0-10).
The higher the level, the more difficult the game will be, as the minos will fall faster.

-------------------------------------
Level Scene:
1. Classic tetris game
2. Has a preview window, in which displays the next mino that will be spawned.
3. Display the current score the player got so far (base on how many lines he/she cleans, and how fast he/she place the minos)
4. Display the current level (level will increase for every 3000 scores).
5. Display the history high level.
6. Has a pause button that can pause the game when being clicked.
7. Has a go back button that will bring the player back to game menu (a confirmation window will pop up once the button is pressed)

-------------------------------------
Gameover Scene:
1. Display the gameover message (with animation to make the effect more appealing)
2. Display how many scores the play got this time.
3. Display the history high score.
4. Display "New Record" if new high score is achieved.
